inferable:
# - Is synthetic hydrogen a synthetic fuel?
# - Are biofuels renewable fuels?
# - Is lignite disjoint with hard coal?
# - Are generator, heater and turbine disjoint with one another?
# - Is carbon monoxide an air pollutant?
# - Is nitrous oxide classified as a greenhouse gas?
# - Which are the types of fluorinated greenhouse gases?
# - What is the disposition of biogas and liquid biofuel?
# - Methane is gaseous under normal pressure (1 bar) and normal temperature (0Â°C).
# - Biodiesel is a liquid bio fuel.
# - Is charcoal a solid biofuel?
#
# further ideas:
#  emissions emitted by ... are greenhouse gas emissions

non-inferable:

# Wind turbines are not powered by coal
- Given c is a wind turbine and c has_input some Coal
  Then, infer that the scenario is inconsistent;

# Hot things carry energy
- Given HotThing is defined as a `bfo:material entity` and `ro:is_bearer_of` some `thermal energy`
  Then, infer that every HotThing is an `oeo:energy_carrier`;

# Renewable energy cannot come from non-renewable energy
- Given c is a `energy conversion` and c `has_output` o and o is a renewable energy and c `has_input` i and i is an energy
  Then, infer that i is a renewable energy ;

# A scenario can be used in different model calculations
- Given s is a scenario specification and m1 is an energy model and m2 is an energy model and mc1 is a model calculation that conforms_to s and mc2 is a model calculation that conforms_to s
  Then don't infer that mc1 is mc2

# An agent is not a person - this is a common mistake in the domain
- No agent is a person

# - Given a scenario has some assumption about energy prices, then this scenario covers the energy sector
# - A pump storage stores kinetic energy
# - Every portion of hydrogen is an energy carrier
# - Energy that is produced by a PV panel is renewable
# - Energy that is produced by a coal powerplant is non-renewable
# - An offshore wind farm must be located in some off-shore location
